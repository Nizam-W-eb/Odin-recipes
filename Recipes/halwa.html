    <p><strong>Suji ka halwa</strong> is your classic everyday delicious North Indian sweet made with fine semolina or cream of wheat (farina), sugar, ghee, nuts and flavored with cardamom powder. In Maharashtra, this sweet is called as Sheera. Semolina is called as suji, sooji or rava. This easy melt-in-the-mouth halwa recipe comes together in about 15 minutes. The recipe I share is a family heirloom recipe that we have been making for decades during family get-togethers, special occasions and festivals.</p>
